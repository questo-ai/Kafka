Kafka is an advanced Natural Language Processing library written in Swift. It's built for speed, simplicity, and easy integration into apps. Kafka currently provides linear **neural network models** for tagging and parsing, with pretrained models and word vectors. It's commercial open-source software, released under the MIT license.

## Requirements
iOS 12.0+ | macOS 10.14+ | Mac Catalyst 13.0+ | tvOS 12.0+ | watchOS 5.0+
## Integration
#### CocoaPods

You can use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/) to install `Kafka` by adding it to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
platform :ios, '13.0'
use_frameworks!

target 'MyApp' do
    pod 'Kafka'
end
```

#### Carthage
You can use [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) to install `Kafka` by adding it to your `Cartfile`:

```
github "questo-ai/kafka"
```

If you use Carthage to build your dependencies, make sure you have added `Kafka.framework` to the "Linked Frameworks and Libraries" section of your target, and have included them in your Carthage framework copying build phase.

## Usage
#### Initialization

```swift
import Kafka
```

```swift
// Initialise a dependency parser
let parser = DependencyParser()
```

#### Parsing

```swift
let doc = Doc(string: "Memories warm you up from the inside. But they also tear you apart.") // From Haruki Murakami, Kafka on the Shore
let result = parser.predict(text: doc)
```
#### Use dependency data
```swift
/// The dependency arcs is stored as a property of Doc, with type [[(Int, Int, String)]]
/// arcs is a list of triples (idx_head, idx_dep, deprel) signifying the
/// dependency relation `idx_head ->_deprel idx_dep`, where idx_head is
/// the index of the head word, idx_dep is the index of the dependant,
/// and deprel is a string representing the dependency relation label.
print(result.arcs)
```
