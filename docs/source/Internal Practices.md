# Internal Practices

## Documentation Updates

Documentation should be edited in the [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/). A different markdown editor can be used, if desired. However, StackEdit must be used to export the markdown into a HTML file, because the way GitHub renders Markdown is ugly. 

## Development Practises

**Branches**
All development should take place on `dev` or other branches *specifically intended for development*. The `master` branch is *only for production releases*. 

**Sparing Push**
When pushing, don't just push all edited files. Select the changes appropriately and thoughtfully. Don't push tiny or otherwise meaningless changes. Merge conflicts should be avoided as much as possible.
