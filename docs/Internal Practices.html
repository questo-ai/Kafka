<p>Documentation should be edited in the <a href="https://stackedit.io/">StackEdit</a>. A different markdown editor can be used, if desired. However, StackEdit must be used to export the markdown into a HTML file, because the way GitHub renders Markdown is ugly.</p>
<p><strong>Values of Instance Variables</strong><br>
Where an instance variable stores an object, mention it in the single-sentence description. Otherwise, include a line e.g. <em>Value: <code>1</code></em>.</p>
<p><strong>Constant vs. Mutable</strong><br>

<p><strong>Branches</strong><br>
All development should take place on <code>dev</code> or other branches <em>specifically intended for development</em>. The <code>master</code> branch is <em>only for production releases</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Sparing Push</strong><br>
When pushing, don’t just push all edited files. Select the changes appropriately and thoughtfully. Don’t push tiny or otherwise meaningless changes. Merge conflicts should be avoided as much as possible.</p>
